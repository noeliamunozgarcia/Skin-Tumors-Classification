# Skin Tumors Classification

The project aims to classify skin tumors by their images as  "**Benign Tumors**" or "**Malignant Tumors**".<br/>
The dataset used if from the ISIC 2019 challenge.  
This project is based on the article **[Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection 2018: A Challenge Hosted by the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.03368)**. 

## How to run the project
1. Clone this repository
```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/noeliamunozgarcia/Skin-Tumors-Classification.git
``` 
2. Navigate to the directory containing this `README` in a terminal.
```sh
    $ cd YOUR_PATH/Skin-Tumors-Classification/
``` 
3. Download the dataset from  <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/isic-2019"> Kaggle </a>.
4. Copy the images in [/data/images/](/data/images/). <br/>






## Getting Started

So that the repository is successfully cloned and the project runs smoothly, a few steps need to be followed.

### Requisites

* A good amount of cores (GPU is better) and RAM.
* Free disk space (> 10GB) is required.
* ``anaconda``, ``pytorch``, and ``torchvision`` are required.

### Installation and Use

```sh
   $ git clone https://github.com/antonioscardace/ISIC-2019-v2.git
   $ cd YOUR_PATH/ISIC-2019-v2/
   $ mkdir models
``` 

Now download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/isic-2019) and put images in [/data/images/](/data/images/). <br/>
Then, you can use any notebook in [/notebooks/](/notebooks/).
